# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI

- **Role Management**: Create, edit, and delete roles.
- **Permission Management**: Assign and manage permissions for roles.
- **Dynamic Access Control**: Render content dynamically based on user roles and permissions.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
